Moving Time, Speed, and Pace Calculations

What is the difference between moving time and elapsed time?
Elapsed time is the duration from the moment you hit start on your device or phone to the moment you finish the activity.
It includes stoplights, coffee breaks, bathroom stops and stopping for photos.
Moving time, on the other hand, is a measure of how long you were active.
Strava will attempt to calculate this based on the GPS locations, distance, and speed of your activity.
For runs, we will forego our calculation if you use your pause button and respect the moving time directly from the device instead.

PACE:
To calculate your average pace while running, you can divide your run time by your distance and if you run 3 miles in 30 minutes that means 30 min/3 miles= 10 minutes per mile pace.
